# webex-calling-api-examples
This repo provides a Postman collection that demonstrates the use of the [Webex Calling API](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/guides/webex-calling).
  
To excercise these API simply do the following
* [Install Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
* [Import the collection](#import-the-collection)
* [Configure the environment](#configure-the-environment)
* [Exercise the requests](#exercise-the-resquests)

## Import the collection
1) Clone this repo or simply download the [postman collection](./webex-calling-calls-api.json) to your local disk.
2) From within Postman , begin by clicking the "Import" button, and choosing the "Choose Files" button:

  ![Postman Import](./images/import.png)

When imported succesfully you should see new collection called "Webex Calling Calls API" in postman.

## Configure the Environment

This collection uses "collection level" variables, which simply means that you can specify an environment that is unique to you, directly from within the collection itself.   

The environment variables are: 

* WEBEX_TOKEN -- an OAuth token for a user configured for calling in the test environment. These tests require a token with all the calling scopes (spark:calls_read and spark:calls_write).  To get started quickly, developers can copy their temporary token from the [Webex For Developers Gettings Started Guide](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/getting-started#accounts-and-authentication). 
* WEBEX_API_URL -- the URL of the API under test, generally the default value of "https://webexapis.com/v1/" does not need to be changed
* DESTINATION -- The destination to be dialed. Destination can be extensions, PSTN numbers, FAC codes or SIP URI. The destination can be digits or a URI. Some examples for destination include: 1234, 2223334444, +12223334444, *73, tel:+12223334444, user@company.domain, sip:user@company.domain
* TRANSFER_DESTINATION -- The destination to be dialed. This is used to make a second call from the api user in order to transfer the call.
* PARK_DESTINATION  -- The destination to park the call.
  
To edit the variables first click on the "three dots" associated with the collection and select edit

  ![Edit Collection](./images/edit-collection.png)

Then click on the "Variables" tab and update the values in the "Current Value" column as you need to:

  ![Set Variables](./images/set-variables.png)

If you are familar with Postman's environments, its worth noting that you don't need to explicity set an environment to run these requests, since all the variables are set at the collection level.  If you do have an active environment that sets any of the environment variables used by this collection, the active environment variables will take precedence. 

Click the update button and you are ready to try the requests.

## Exercise the requests

The collection consists of five folders that exercise the following use cases:

1) Create an outbound (Click to Dial) Call and verify it is gettable and perform a basic Hold and Resume operation on the call.
2) Answer an inbound call (UserA calls apiUser), intiatate another call from the same user (apiUser calls UserB) and perform a Consult Transfer (i.e. apiUser transfers the call to connect UserA with UserB)
3) Answer an inbound call (UserA calls apiUser) and blind transfer (Divert) the call to apiUser's voicemail.
4) Answer an inbound call, park the call on another destination and retrieve the call back to apiUser.
5) Answer an inbound call, start recording, the pause recording, resume recording and stop call recording and then end the call.
**Note:** The apiUser must be enabled for Call Recording in Control Hub and should have "On Demand" Call Recording option selected. Also, the apiUser information must be provisioned the Dubber account (i.e. user and dub point should be created prior to using these APIs)
6) Get Call History (i.e. missed calls, placed calls and received calls).

Each folder is standalone, but the requests are meant to be run one after the other.

After sending the request scroll down to see the response.  The "Test Results" section will provide information on which tests passed (or failed).

  ![Response](./images/response.png)

Inspect the request and respone to better understand how the API works and move on to the next request in the folder.

The last request in each folder will run a pre-request script that will "clean up" the temporary environment variables that were set and used in the pre-request and test script.

Have fun!
